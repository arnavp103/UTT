# UTT
A timetable builder for students to figure out course prerequisites. Has functionality to:
- Write past courses you've done so that the prerequisite list of courses you're searching for will be automagically culled. 
- Animations to make the page smoothly flow.
- Some notion of SOLID design was in the minds of the team that worked on this.
- A registration system so your past courses can be stored and recieved when you login.

<br/>
Can handle live updates, and deletes to the course list and students will have their view automatically updated. 
Designed for Android API levels 31 and above.
